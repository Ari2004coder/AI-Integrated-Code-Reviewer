❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {
  return a + b;
}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ **Undeclared Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are used without being declared or passed as arguments to the `sum` function. This will result in a `ReferenceError` when the function is called.
*   ❌ **Lack of Parameters**: The function `sum` does not accept any parameters, making `a` and `b` undefined within its scope.
*   ❌ **Poor Readability/Maintainability**: It's unclear what `a` and `b` are intended to represent or where they are supposed to come from.
*   ❌ **No Type Safety/Validation**: There's no mechanism to ensure that the inputs (if they were parameters) are indeed numbers, which could lead to unexpected results (e.g., `'1' + '2'` results in `'12'`).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} num1 - The first number.
 * @param {number} num2 - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
 */
function sum(num1, num2) {
  // Basic type checking to ensure inputs are numbers
  if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
    // Or throw an error: throw new TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.");
    console.error("Warning: sum() expects two numbers as arguments.");
    // Attempt conversion or return a default/error value
    num1 = Number(num1) || 0;
    num2 = Number(num2) || 0;
  }
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3));    // Output: 8
// console.log(sum("5", 3)); // Output: Warning... 8 (after conversion)
// console.log(sum(10));     // Output: Warning... 10 (after conversion, num2 becomes 0)
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ **Defined Parameters**: `num1` and `num2` are now clearly defined as parameters for the `sum` function, making it self-contained and reusable.
*   ✔ **Improved Readability**: Parameter names are descriptive, indicating their purpose.
*   ✔ **Basic Type Checking/Robustness**: Added a check to ensure that inputs are numbers, making the function more robust against incorrect usage and preventing unexpected behavior like string concatenation.
*   ✔ **JSDoc Documentation**: Included a JSDoc comment block to clearly describe the function's purpose, its parameters (with types), and what it returns. This greatly enhances maintainability and understanding for other developers (or your future self!).
*   ✔ **Error Handling/Warnings**: Provides a warning when inputs are not numbers, and attempts to convert them, preventing runtime crashes. Depending on requirements, throwing an error (`throw new TypeError(...)`) might be more appropriate for strict validation.
